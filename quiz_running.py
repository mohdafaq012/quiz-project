# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Block 1: gettin all the libraries we need
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ok so we need all this stuff to make the app work.
# streamlit: this is for the web app itself, the user interface part.
import streamlit as st
# langchain_groq: this lets us use the super fast LLM from Groq.
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
# langchain.prompts: we use this to build a template, basically a set of instructions for the LLM.
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
# dotenv: this is just to load our API key from the .env file so we dont have to write it directly in the code.
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# langchain_core.output_parsers: these help get the output from the LLM into a format we can actually use, like a simple string or JSON.
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser, JsonOutputParser
# bs4 (BeautifulSoup): this helps clean up the messy HTML code from a website and pull out the text.
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# requests: this is for grabbing data from a URL, like the HTML of a webpage.
import requests
# readability: this library is really good at finding the main article content on a page and getting rid of junk like ads and menus.
from readability import Document
# json: the LLM will give us data in JSON format, so we need this to work with it in Python.
import json
# re (Regular Expressions): for finding the clean JSON inside the LLM's response, which can sometimes be a bit messy. its a pattern matching tool.
import re




# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Block 2: loading up the API keys and getting set up
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# alright, lets load the environment variables.
# this line will look for a .env file and load any keys inside it.
load_dotenv()




# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Block 3: getting the LLM (the "brain") and the Prompt ready
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# here we're setting up the LLM we're gonna use.
# we're using Groq's "llama-3.1-8b-instant" model cause its really fast.
model = ChatGroq(model_name="llama-3.1-8b-instant")

# now we're making a script for the LLM to follow.
# its a PromptTemplate, like a form that we fill out to tell the LLM what to do.
quiz_from_text_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    # these are the variables in the template that we'll fill in later.
    # in this case, 'num_questions' and 'article_text'.
    input_variables=["num_questions", "article_text"],
    # partial_variables means a part of the template is already pre-filled.
    # here we're telling the LLM the exact JSON format to use so it doesnt mess up.
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": JsonOutputParser().get_format_instructions()},
    # and this is the main script we're giving the LLM. all the rules are here.
    template="""
You are a quiz generator that must follow the rules strictly.

Rules:
1. Use ONLY the provided text.
2. Create {num_questions} MCQs with 4 options (Aâ€“D).
3. You MUST include the "correct_answer" key for every question. This is mandatory.
4. Do not invent facts.
5. Keep each question under 25 words.
6. Output must be valid JSON that adheres to the schema below. Do not add any text before or after the JSON.

{format_instructions}

Text passage (max 1500 words):
\"\"\"{article_text}\"\"\"

Generate the quiz now:
"""
)

# here we're creating a processing pipeline, they call it a "chain".
# it just defines the sequence of steps for our data.
# 1. first, user input goes into the 'quiz_from_text_prompt' to build the full prompt.
# 2. then, that prompt goes to the 'model' (our LLM).
# 3. finally, whatever the LLM gives back, 'StrOutputParser' cleans it up into a simple string.
chain = quiz_from_text_prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
